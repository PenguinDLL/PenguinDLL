- 👋 Hi, I’m @PenguinDLL
- 👀 I’m interested in too many things to count
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, project management, and maybe other things too
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on health related applications, but I'm sure I don't have time for it
- 📫 You should not reach out to [me](48712945+PenguinDLL@users.noreply.github.com)
